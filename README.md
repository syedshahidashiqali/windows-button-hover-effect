# Calculating the cursor position
Simple logic to calculate position relative to the element: 
`find the difference of cursor position coordinates and starting coordinates of the target element`

The syntax for `border-image` is

`source | slice | border-width | border-outset | slice-repeat`

Now you might be wondering what are those extra values with the radial gradient.

- **20% 75%**: The `horizontal and vertical radius` of the gradient ellipse shape. % indicates that much % of parentâ€™s width and height respectively.
- **slice (9)**: the radial-gradient is our source image for the border and the `slice property divides that image into 9 regions` which it then `applies to edges and corners of the element specified`.
- **width (2px)**: the `thickness of the border-image`
- **outset (2px)**: the `space between the border and the element`
- **repeat (stretch)**: this value specifies `how the 9 regions, are applied to the image and edges`. How the regions 5,6,7,8 specified here are `repeated in the border`
